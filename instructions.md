==================================
## Filter that list!!
==================================

1. The <App> is the only component that will manage state.
   and display the necessary data in the <List> component.

2. Create a <Filter> Component that renders the following JSX
   to begin with:

   <div className="header">
      <h4 className="filter_title">X items filtered</h4>
      <input className="filter"/>
   </div>

3. The <Filter> component should filter the list of data objects it will be given
   by the 'first_name' key, and will check if it includes the typed text in its <input>
   The trigger for filtering is 'onchange' event on the <input> you will implement.
   It is supposed to have effect on the <App> component state, which will be reflected
   by the <List> component.

4. The instance of the <Filter> component will be created in the <App> component only!
   The <List> and <Filter> components are siblings.

5. The <Filter> component should display the number of filtered items in the <h4> tag.

6. The <Filter> component should define the props it suppose to get
   in a proper interface.
